# rub-kgi

This is an **UNOFFICIAL** Github organization that hosts repositories useful for students and/or employees of the art history institute (Kunstgeschichtliches Institut) at Ruhr University Bochum.

I am not a member of the institute but rather a student of electrical engineering at Ruhr University Bochum who happens to be friends with students of art history whom I wanted to help writing consistent, well formated documents according to the official KGI guidelines by providing LaTeX packages and/or classes.

If you are entitled to speak for the institute (e.g. Fachschaftsrat) you may contact me with your RUB email to get the ownership of this organisation transferred to the institute and make this Github organization official.
